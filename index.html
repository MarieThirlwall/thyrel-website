                <h2>About Thyrel</h2>
                <p>Thyrel Ltd was founded by Marie Thirlwall as a microSME helping businesses break through into markets. The term <span class="rune-inline">þyrel</span> in Old English refers to a hole or aperture — fitting perfectly with the challenges of opening new windows into customer insights, or piercing through existing markets to secure new advantages.</p>
                <p>We support customers with business services along their entire journey, from discovery to maximising market potential.</p>
