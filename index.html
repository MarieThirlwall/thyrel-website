                <h2>About Thyrel</h2>
                <p>Thyrel Ltd was founded by Marie Thirlwall as a microSME helping businesses break through into markets. The term <span class="rune-inline">þyrel</span>, or 'Thyrel' in Old English refers to a hole or aperture. This seemed very fitting with the challenges of opening new windows into customer insights, or piercing through existing markets to secure a growth or impact advantage.</p>
